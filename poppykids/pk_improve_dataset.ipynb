    "\n",
    "As I am not a professional dentist, I am unable to write high-level questions myself. The ideal approach would be to search the web for high-quality questions that matches the topics and style I want the LLM to generate. However, this method is very time-consuming. A more efficient approach is to use the \"critique and revise\" method, where the LLM first generates critiques on how each Q&A can be improved. We then ask the LLM to rewrite the questions based on these critiques. Finally, we fine-tune the LLM on the revised Questions."

      "**Parent:**\n",
      "\n",
      "* \"How can I prevent my child from getting cavities?\" - This question is quite broad. Consider making it more specific, such as \"What are some effective ways to prevent cavities in children under 5?\" or \"How can I prevent cavities in my child's baby teeth?\"\n",
      "* \"What are the early signs of tooth decay in kids?\" - This question is relevant and specific. No improvement needed.\n",
      "* \"Is it true that baby teeth are not that important since they'll fall out anyway?\" - This question could be rephrased to sound more conversational, such as \"Do baby teeth really matter if they're just going to fall out?\"\n",
      "* \"How often should I take my child to the dentist to prevent dental caries?\" - This question could be more specific, such as \"What is the recommended frequency for dental check-ups for children under 10?\"\n",
      "* \"Can I use regular toothpaste for my toddler or is there a special kind?\" - This question is relevant and specific. No improvement needed.\n",
      "* \"Are there any specific foods or drinks that I should limit to prevent cavities in my child?\" - This question could be more specific, such as \"Are there any specific snacks or beverages that I should avoid giving my child to prevent cavities?\"\n",

      "**Teen:**\n",
      "\n",
      "* \"I don't like going to the dentist, can't I just take care of my teeth myself?\" - This question could be rephrased to sound more conversational, such as \"Can I really take care of my teeth on my own, or do I need to see a dentist regularly?\"\n",
      "* \"How can I get rid of the white spots on my teeth that my dentist said are early signs of cavities?\" - This question is relevant and specific. No improvement needed.\n",
      "* \"Is it true that sugary drinks like soda and sports drinks can cause cavities?\" - This question could be more specific, such as \"How do sugary drinks like soda and sports drinks contribute to cavities?\"\n",
      "* \"Can I still get cavities if I wear braces?\" - This question is relevant and specific. No improvement needed.\n",
      "* \"How long does it take to get a cavity filled and will it hurt?\" - This question could be more specific, such as \"What's the typical process for getting a cavity filled, and what can I expect in terms of pain or discomfort?\"\n",
      "* \"Can I prevent cavities by chewing sugar-free gum?\" - This question could be more specific, such as \"Does chewing sugar-free gum really help prevent cavities, and how does it work?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "**Dentist:**\n",
      "\n",
      "* \"What are the most effective ways to prevent dental caries in children?\" - This question is quite broad. Consider making it more specific, such as \"What are some evidence-based strategies for preventing dental caries in children under 5?\"\n",
      "* \"How can I educate parents on the importance of oral hygiene for their kids?\" - This question could be more specific, such as \"What are some effective ways to communicate the importance of oral hygiene to parents of young children?\"\n",
      "* \"What are the latest advancements in treating dental caries in children?\" - This question is relevant and specific. No improvement needed.\n",
      "* \"Can you recommend any specific products or tools for preventing cavities in kids?\" - This question could be more specific, such as \"What are some evidence-based products or tools that can help prevent cavities in children?\"\n",
      "* \"How can I identify dental caries in its early stages in children?\" - This question is relevant and specific. No improvement needed.\n",
      "* \"What are the consequences of leaving dental caries untreated in children?\" - This question could be more specific, such as \"What are the potential long-term consequences of untreated dental caries in children, and how can they be prevented?\"\n",
