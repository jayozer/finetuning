    "As I am not a professional dentist, I am unable to write high-level faq questions myself. The ideal approach would be to search the web for high-quality questions that matches the topics and style I want the LLM to generate or use a team of dentists. However, this method is very time-consuming (Kind of, I have the scripts for this and should try out). A more efficient approach (most definitely) is to use the \"critique and revise\" method, where the LLM first generates critiques on how each Q&A can be improved. We then ask the LLM to rewrite the questions based on these critiques. Finally, we fine-tune the LLM on the revised Questions."

      "Here's a list of potential improvements for each question, along with explanations for why these changes are necessary and how they would enhance the question's effectiveness:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. What's the best way to prevent cavities in my toddler's baby teeth?\n",
      "* Improvement: Specify the age range of the toddler (e.g., \"What's the best way to prevent cavities in my 1-3 year old child's baby teeth?\").\n",
      "* Reason: This change helps tailor the answer to a specific age group, ensuring the advice is relevant and actionable for parents of toddlers.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. How do I know if my child has a cavity, and what are the symptoms?\n",
      "* Improvement: Break this into two separate questions: \"What are the common symptoms of cavities in children?\" and \"How can I identify a cavity in my child's teeth?\"\n",
      "* Reason: This change allows for more focused answers and reduces the likelihood of a lengthy, confusing response.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. Can children get cavities from breast milk or formula?\n",
      "* Improvement: Rephrase the question to \"Can breast milk or formula contribute to tooth decay in infants, and how can I minimize the risk?\"\n",
      "* Reason: This change helps to clarify the relationship between breast milk/formula and tooth decay, and encourages a more informative answer.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. Is it true that giving my child a bottle of juice before bedtime can cause tooth decay?\n",
      "* Improvement: Broaden the question to \"How does juice consumption affect my child's oral health, and what are some healthy alternatives for bedtime drinks?\"\n",
      "* Reason: This change allows for a more comprehensive answer that addresses the impact of juice on oral health and provides actionable advice for parents.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. How often should I take my child to the dentist to check for cavities?\n",
      "* Improvement: Specify the age range or developmental stage of the child (e.g., \"How often should I take my preschooler to the dentist for cavity checks?\").\n",
      "* Reason: This change helps to provide a more tailored answer, as dental visit frequency may vary depending on the child's age and oral health needs.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. What's the difference between a cavity and tooth sensitivity in kids?\n",
      "* Improvement: Rephrase the question to \"How can I distinguish between tooth sensitivity and a cavity in my child, and what are the implications for treatment?\"\n",
      "* Reason: This change encourages a more detailed answer that addresses the differences between these two conditions and provides guidance on how to proceed.\n",
      "\n",
      "7. Can cavities in baby teeth affect my child's permanent teeth?\n",
      "* Improvement: Expand the question to \"How do cavities in baby teeth impact my child's overall oral health, and what are the potential long-term effects on their permanent teeth?\"\n",
      "* Reason: This change allows for a more comprehensive answer that addresses the broader implications of cavities in baby teeth.\n",
      "\n",
      "8. Are there any natural remedies or home treatments that can reverse or prevent tooth decay in children?\n",
      "* Improvement: Rephrase the question to \"What are some evidence-based, non-invasive methods for preventing tooth decay in children, and what are the limitations of natural remedies?\"\n",
      "* Reason: This change encourages a more balanced answer that highlights the importance of evidence-based approaches and discusses the potential limitations of natural remedies.\n",
      "\n",
      "Additional suggestions:\n",
      "\n",
      "* Consider adding questions that address common misconceptions or myths about pediatric dentistry, such as \"Does sugar-free gum prevent cavities in kids?\" or \"Can I use a regular toothbrush for my infant's teeth?\"\n",
      "* Include questions that focus on prevention and proactive oral health strategies, such as \"What are some healthy snack options for kids that can help prevent tooth decay?\" or \"How can I encourage good oral hygiene habits in my child?\"\n",
      "* Ensure that the questions are diverse and cover a range of topics, including diet, oral hygiene, and dental visit frequency, to provide a comprehensive resource for parents and caregivers.\n"

The evaluation_split parameter allows you to configure the amount of training data used for evaluation. The default evaluation split is 15% of the training data. You can adjust this split.
