### **First Visit (Initial Appointment)**

The American Academy of Pediatric Dentistry (AAPD) recommends that every child see a pediatric dentist (children's dental specialist) for an initial oral evaluation (first dental check-up) by **age 1** or within **6 months** of the arrival of their first tooth. Establishing a dental home early helps build lifelong habits for a healthy smile (good oral health).
